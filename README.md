# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

Users can register to the app, and access their shortened URL library. Tha app allows users to create new URLs, and edit or delete the existing ones.

Only logged users can access, edit or delete the URLs library. The shortened URL redirects the user to the correspondent website. 

Security measures were implemented such as hased passwords and encrypted cookies.
